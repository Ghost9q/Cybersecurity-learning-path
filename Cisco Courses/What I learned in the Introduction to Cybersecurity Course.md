# What I Learned in *Introduction to Cybersecurity* (Cisco Networking Academy)

In this course, I gained a solid understanding of the foundational concepts of cybersecurity. I learned the difference between **organizational data** and **personal data**, and how both need to be protected using
strong security practices. 

The course covered various **cyber threats** and **attack techniques** used by hackers and threat actors, including:

- Phishing
- Malware
- Social engineering
- Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks

All of these threats can seriously impact the security of an organizationâ€™s networks and data centers.

## ðŸ§± McCumber Cube Framework

One of the key models I studied was the **McCumber Cube**, a well-known framework for ensuring **information security** in an organization. The model is built on **three key dimensions**:

1. **Security Principles**  
   - Confidentiality  
   - Integrity  
   - Availability (CIA Triad)

2. **Information States**  
   - Data in transit  
   - Data at rest  
   - Data in processing  

3. **Security Measures**  
   - Technology  
   - Policy and procedures  
   - Human factors

This model helped me understand how to apply layered security by considering all aspects of how data is handled and protected.

The course also introduced me to various **career paths in cybersecurity**, such as:

- Cybersecurity Analyst  
- Penetration Tester  
- Incident Responder  
- Security Engineer

I now have a clearer understanding of the responsibilities in these roles â€” from identifying vulnerabilities and monitoring threats to responding to incidents and defending digital systems.
